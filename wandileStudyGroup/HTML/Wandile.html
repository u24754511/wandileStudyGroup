            <p>
                Wandile Mngomezulu was born in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, and later moved to Pretoria to
                pursue his BIT in Information Systems at the University of Pretoria. From an early age, he was
                fascinated by how technology shapes the world and knew he wanted to be part of that change.
                His decision to study Information Systems was driven by his love for problem-solving and his
                passion for innovation.

                Wandile is a thrill-seeker who enjoys pushing his limits.
                He is drawn to high-adrenaline activities like rock climbing, bungee jumping, and off-road biking.
                The rush of excitement fuels his energy, but when exhaustion sets in, he turns to his more relaxed hobby—watching anime.
                For Wandile, anime is not just entertainment; it’s an escape into imaginative worlds filled with adventure, deep storytelling,
                and unforgettable characters. Whether he's exploring the outdoors or diving into a binge-watch session,
                he is always chasing experiences that keep life exciting.
